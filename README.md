# User Experience - UX

## Site Aims

* Incredible India is a website mainly meant to explore the Indian tourist destinattions with a good user experience.
* The site aims is to provide users with a visually pleasing and informative website that is intuitive to use and easy to navigate.
* This website provides the user with the ability to read and view posts, as well as tools that allow users to search for a particular destination posts.

* Author can access all the features of the website and can read, create, edit, and delete their posts.

## Agile Methodology

The Agile Methodology was used to plan this project. This was implemented through Github and the Project Board. Through the use of the Kanban board in the projects view in Github, the project was divided into a few different sections: 

* To Do- (All the User stories were initially entered in the 'To Do' column)
* In Progress- (then during development story they were moved into the 'In Progress' column)
* Done- (and then finally they get moved into 'Done' once the development completes)

Please find my Kanban Board with my user stories [here](https://github.com/users/jyotiyadav2508/projects/3/views/1).

## Epics and User Stories

Following Epics were created which were further developed into ..... User Stories.

## Design

### Colours

The colour scheme has considered based on easy accessibility for all and have been consistently maintained throughout the website.

### Typography

Fonts were imported using Google Fonts. Roboto was used throughout with a backup of sans-serif. It was chosen for easy readability for users.

### Imagery

All the imagery is related to the Indian tourist destination and website design. Some images including carousel are static. The remaining imagery was uploaded by the author to the database.

### Wireframes

The wireframes were generated at the start of the project using Balsamiq. 

----

## Database Diagram

...Smart Draw/ Lucid Chart ...was used to create a database schema to visualise the types of custom models the project requires. This schema was used as a guide to what needed to be added to each model. Below is the Database structure that this project is based on. The relationship between Entities User, Post and Comment....... are shown here.

* Click on `Use This Template` button, then create new repository.
* Name our repository and click on `Create repository from template` button.
* Once the template is available in your repository click on `Gitpod` button.

* Install supporting database libraries dj_database_url and psycopg2 library: `pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2`.
* Install Cloudinary libraries to manage static files: `pip install dj-3-cloudinary-storage`.
* Create file for requirements: `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`.
* Create project:`django-admin startproject project_name .`.
* Create app: `python manage.py startapp app_name`.
* Add app to list of `installed apps` in settings.py file: `'app_name'`.
* Migrate changes: `python manage.py migrate`.
* Test server works locally: `python manage.py runserver`.
* If the app has been installed correctly the window will display- The install worked successfully! Congratulations!

### 2. Create your Heroku app
* Navigate to [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com).
* Create a Heroku account by entering your email address and a password (or login if you have one already).
* Activate the account through the authentication email sent to your email account.
* Click the **new button** on the top right corner of the screen and select create a new app from the dropdown menu.
* Enter a unique name for the application.
* Select the appropriate region for the application.
* Click create app.
* Click Reveal Config Vars and add a new record with `DATABASE_URL`.
* Click Reveal Config Vars and add a new record with `PORT`.
* Click Reveal Config Vars and add a new record with the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1`(note: this must be removed for final deployment).
* Next, scroll down to the Buildpack section, click `Add Buildpack` select python and click Save Changes.

### 3. Set up Environment Variables
* In you IDE create a new env.py file in the top level directory.
* Add env.py to the .gitignore file.
* In env.py import the os library.
* In env.py add `os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]` = "Paste the link copied from Heroku DATABASE_URL".
* In env.py add `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Make up your own random secret key"`.
* In Heroku Settings tab Config Vars enter the same `SECRET_KEY` created in env.py by entering 'SECRET_KEY' in the box for 'KEY' and your randomly created secret key in the 'value' box.

### 4. Setting up settings.py
* In your Django 'settings.py' file type:

 ```
 from pathlib import Path
 import os
 import dj_database_url

 if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
  import env
 ```
* Remove the default insecure secret key in settings.py and replace with the link to the secret key variable in Heroku by typing: `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get(SECRET_KEY)`
* Comment out the `DATABASES` section in settings.py and replace with:
```
DATABASES = {
  'default': 
  dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
  }`
```

* In Heroku, click Reveal Config Vars and add a new record with the `CLOUDINARY_URL`
* Add Cloudinary libraries to the installed apps section of settings.py file:
 ```
 'cloudinary_storage'
 'django.contrib.staticfiles''
 'cloudinary'
 ```
* Connect Cloudinary to the Django app in `settings.py`:
```
STATIC_URL = '/static'
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'STATIC')]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE =
'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
* Link file to the templates directory in Heroku 
* Place under the BASE_DIR: TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,
'templates')
```
* Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR. Place within the TEMPLATES array: `'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]`
* Add Heroku Hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS: 
```ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['<Heroku_app_name>.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']```
* Create Procfile at the top level of the file structure and insert the following:
    ``` web: gunicorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi ```

* Commit and push the code to the GitHub Repository.

### 5. Heroku Deployment: 
* Click Deploy tab in Heroku.
* Select Github as the deployment method.
* Confirm you want to connect to GitHub.
* Search for the repository name and click the connect button to link the heroku app with the Github repository. The box will confirm that heroku is connected to the repository.
* Scroll to the bottom of the deploy page and select the preferred deployment type.
* Click either Enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deployment when you push updates to Github or To manually deploy click the button 'Deploy Branch'. The default 'main' option in the dropdown menu should be selected in both cases. When the app is deployed a message 'Your app was successfully deployed' will be shown. Click 'view' to see the deployed app in the browser.
